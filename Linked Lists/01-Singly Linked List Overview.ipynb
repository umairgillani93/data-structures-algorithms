    "A __Singly linked list__ is it's simplest form is a collection of __nodes__ that collectively form a linear sequence. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each node stores a reference to an object that is an element of the sequence, as well as the reference to the __next node__.\n",
    "The list instance maintains a memeber named __head__ that identifies the first node of the list. In some application, another member named __tail__ that identifies the last node of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can identify the __tail__ as the node having __None__ as it's next reference. This process is commonly known as __Traversing__ the linked list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since, the next reference of a node can be viewed as a __link__ or __pointer__ to another node, the process of traversing a list is known as __pointer hopping__ or __link hopping__\n",
    "\n",
    "A linked list does not have a fixed/predefined size, instead it uses space proportionality to its current number of elements."

    "To insert a new element in at the head of a linked list:\n",
    "* We create a new node \n",
    "* Set its element to the new element \n",
    "* Set its next link to refer to the current head \n",
    "* Then set the list's head to point to the new node.\n",
    "\n",
    "To insert node at the tail, we need to do the following:\n",
    "* Create a node \n",
    "* Assign it's next reference to __None__\n",
    "* Set the next reference of the tail to point to this new node \n",
    "* Then update the tail reference itself to this new node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Removing an element from the __head__ of the singly linked list is essentially the reverse operation of inserting a new element at the head.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can not easily delete the last node of _singly linked list_. Even if we  maintain a tail reference  directly to the last node of the list, we must be able to access the node before the last node in order to remove the last node "

    "## Pros:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Linked lists have constant-time insertions and deletions in any position, in comparison, arrays require O(n) time to do the same thing.\n",
    "* Linked list can continue to expand without having to specify their size ahead of time.\n",

    "## Cons:\n",
    "\n",
    "* To access an element in a linked list, you need to take O(k) time to go from the head of the list to the kth element. In contrast, arrays have contant-time operations to access elements in array."
