    "\n",
    "Referential arrays come to the play when we want to store the information of let's say 100 students.\n",
    "NOw each students will be having a name of different string lenght, and let's say we are bound to use same cell size for storing the names of each student. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we can use __Referential arrays__ for that purpose, which will be referencing each student ID-wise. __And each ID element would be a reference to the Student name__ \n",
    "\n",
    "A very common case of __Referential arrays__ is when we slice a Python list. The new list formed is basically the instance of existing list, and it's indexes refers to the original list indexes from where it'g got slice \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, when we slice a list from list[2:5] the new list indexes say new_list[0] = lis[2], new_list[1] = list[3], new_list[3] = list[4] refers to the indexes of original list\n",
    "\n",
    "When we __shallow copy__ a list, means we just refer the indexes of original list to the backup list.\n",
    "\n",
    "And when we create __deep copy__ it means we create a whole new list with new elements. This is done in case we have a list of __mutable__ type, in case of Python!\n",
    "\n",
    "A great example of Referential arrays is discussed below ..\n",
    "\n",
    "counters = [0] * 8 --> this means we are not creating 8 different integers having values = 0, \n",
    "instead we are just refering 8 indexes a same object i.e 0. And if we go like ..  \n",
    "\n",
    "counters[2] += 1; that also doesn't change the value of existing integer, instead it references that particualar index \n",
    "an object = 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in a nut shell, whenever we make shallow copy of a list, we just changes the reference objects correponding to the list and not the original lists!"
