    "* Computer's main memory performs as __random access memory (RAM)__\n",

    "A group of related variables can be stored one after another in a contiguous portion of the computer's memory. We denote such representation as an __Array__. Moreover, a text __string__ is stored as an ordered sequence of individual characters. __Python__ internally represents each __Unicode__ character with 16 bits (i.e 2 bytes).\n",
