    "## Adjacency Matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the easiest ways to implement a _graph_ is to use a _two-dimentional matrix_. In this matrix implementation, each of the _rows_ and _columns_ represent a _vertex_ in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "When two _vertices_ are connected by an _edge_ we say that they are _Adjacent_. The advantage of the _Adjancency matrix_ is that, it is simple, and for all the graphs it is easy to see which nodes are connected to other nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "But most of the cells in _matrix_ are empty, because of this, the matrix is called a __Sparse Matrix__\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Adjacency List:\n",
    "\n",
    "A more space-efficient way to implement a _sparsely connected graph_ is to use an _Adjacency list_.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a _Adjacency list_ implementation, we keep a master list of all the _Vertices_ in the graph object, and then each _vertex_ object in the graph maintains a list of other _vertices_ it's connected to. \n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of _Adjacency list_ is it allows us to compactly represent a _sparse graph_.\n",
    "The _Adjacency list_ also allows us to easily find all the links that are directly connected to a particular _vertex_"
